# Docker Project

## Introduction to Docker
Docker is a platform that utilizes containers to simplify the development, deployment, and management of applications. Containers enable applications to be packaged with all their dependencies, ensuring consistency across different platforms and environments.

## Key Components

### Docker Engine
Docker Engine is the core tool that manages containers. It runs on the host machine and allows users to build, run, and manage containers using Docker commands.

### Docker Images
Docker images serve as templates containing instructions for creating containers. They act as blueprints for containers, encapsulating everything needed to run an application. Docker images can be stored and shared through repositories like Docker Hub.

## Getting Started
To start using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker on your machine.
2. Pull a Docker image from a repository or create your own.
3. Run containers based on the Docker image.
4. Use Docker commands to manage and interact with containers.
